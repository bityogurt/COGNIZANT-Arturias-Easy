# codeRun_2023

Welcome to codeRun 2023.  
This readme file servers as a short guide for getting started and some useful instructions.

## Prerequisites
In order to facilitate development the following applications should be present on the machine:
* Git [see Git Home](https://git-scm.com/)
* Intellij Community [see download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) (any other Java IDE is accepted)
* VSCode [see download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (Any other JavaScript IDE is accepted)

## Acquiring the code
On person forks the repository and adds the other team members as contributors.
Once a fork is created all of the team members can clone the forked repository and proceed with the preferred collaboration style.

When evaluating the application only  fork\`s `master` branch will be taken into account (if other feature branches where used by team members please proceed to merge them)

Please periodically commit changes.

**As a first step please create a readme file containing the name of each team member.**

## Resources
There is a resource folder which contains a CSV file which will be required for one of the challenges.
